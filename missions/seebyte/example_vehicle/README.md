This is a skeleton mission, which you should replace with a full mission with all of your vehicle-side drivers -- sensors, vehicle drivers & interfaces, etc.

For example, replace uSimMarine with iM300, and the pShare host and port with the corresponding main vehicle community (possibly inside of docker) to ensure the Neptune MOOS environment is contained, and the vehicle drivers can be abstracted away from it.
